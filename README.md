Brief description of all the labs:

1) Data analysis and visualization using tidyverse.
2) Classical statistics problems and random number generation from a given distribution.
3) Finding a posterior and statistical quantities in binomial inference; 6 boxes toy model.
4) Poisson inference; frequentist and bayesian approaches, hypothesis testing; lighthouse problem; signal over background problem.
5) Markov Chain Monte Carlo with JAGS package; hypothesis testing.
6) Markov Chain Monte Carlo; data analysis with tidyverse.
